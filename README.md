# The Oracle Peak üèî

## The Mission

The purpose of the Oracale Peak experiments and research is to explore and build real-time software 
needed to visualise and understand the activity and behaviour of WiFi users and their devices.

The core objectives of the projects are

1. Build or use tools for **information extraction** from WiFi Access Points (APs) and WiFi Clients.
With specific focus on key data points like `BSSID`s, `ESSID`s, `MAC`'s, Authentication algorithms, 
manufacturer information and time related activity.
2. Build **real-time** and low latency resilient pipelining for processing.
3. Clean, transform and **visualize** the data in respectful and anonymized way.
